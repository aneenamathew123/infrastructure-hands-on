#Group based acess control in a linux server

#Scenario:-
A linux system requires a group based acess control to achieve  project isolation, security, and role-based permission management.

It is widely used in environments to prevent unauthorized acess and least-privilege operations.

#Steps taken:-
- Verfied that the user already exists or not
- created a dedicated project group
- created a new user
- Added the new user to the project specific group
- verified the group membership

#Outcome:-
Successfully created a project specific group and added a new user to the group without affecting existing permissions  for better project isolation and controlled acess.
